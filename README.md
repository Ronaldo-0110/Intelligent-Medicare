### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/loki07-07/Intellimedicare.git
   cd Intellimedicare
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
